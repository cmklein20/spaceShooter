# spaceShooter

Fly a space ship through space and shoot asteroids as they pass by. Shooting asteroids will give you points, and reaching a certain amount of points will move you on to the next level. On later levels, you have a fuel guage. If you run out of fuel you lose. Shoot fuel capsules to increase fuel level.
